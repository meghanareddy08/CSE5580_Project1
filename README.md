# CSE5580 Project 1

This project implements a messaging server simulator using TCP/IP sockets. It allows multiple nodes to connect to a central server and communicate with each other.

## Directory Structure
- Main.py: Main class for starting the server and nodes.
- Server.py: Server class for managing client connections and communication.
- Node.py: Node class representing clients that connect to the server.
- Makefile: Build file for the project.
- README.md: Instructions and overview of the project.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run `python Main.py <number_of_nodes>` to start the server and nodes. Replace `<number_of_nodes>` with the desired number of nodes.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the nodes.
